### **What is your payment cycle? Is there a minimum threshold for payments?**  
We follow a 60 day payment cycle. The payment will be processed 60 days after an invoice has been raised by the Publisher.  
The minimum payment threshold is $1000 USD to avoid additional bank charges and duties.  

### **How are the payments transferred?**  
The payments are done through a bank transfer directly into your Bank account or to your Paypal account.  

### **Why is the revenue that I saw yesterday is different today?**
Advertisers run different types of campaigns on your App's inventory. In some cases, the revenue gets credited after some time due to verification of data. For the same verification reason, the revenue can also get decreased. Typically this value changes in the 72 hour time period with more volatility but in some cases takes upto 30 days to consolidate. The actual revenue accrued will be mentioned in the final invoice generated for your account at the end of the month.
